# selfDrivingBots

It is in a very early stage, not ready for explanations yet.

The project01 folder got some files.

A very quick description would be:

- A small bot with 2 dc 6v motors.
- Has a Wemos D1 (arduino uno clone) with esp8266 wifi build in.
- Has a L298N motor driver (H-bridge) to controll the motors.
- Has an 12v battery for power.
- Can carry an Android phone (to see the road, using IP Webcam from google play).
- A python program displays the cam image, and transmitts user controls to wemos via wifi.

this is what it is for now.
